Create awesome pixel art wallpapers from your favorite subreddits!

## Installation
To install on windows, simply download the installation executable from https://devinarena.com/projects/pixelbackground. The EXE is a one click installer and should generate a shortcut on your desktop. The default location of saved images is C:/USER/PixelBackgroundPictures.

## Usage
Pixel Backgrounds contains 2 modes, save mode and wallpaper mode.

### Save Images Mode
This mode is for downloading and saving a multiple images at once. Simply specify the subreddits, number of images from each, save directory, and degree of pixelation, and submit to have the program automatically download and pixelate your images. A maximum of 50 images can be grabbed at a time.

### Set Wallpaper Mode
This mode is for setting your wallpaper, you specify a target subreddit, save directory, and degree of pixelation, and submit to have the program automatically download and pixelate your image as well as setting it as your desktop background.

## Degree of Pixelation
Pixel Backgrounds uses a simple algorithm to pixelate images. It takes the degree of pixelation and sets every Xth pixel to be X size, where X is the degree of pixelation. This creates a pixel art effect. I've found the best results with pixelation to be between 10 and 20.
